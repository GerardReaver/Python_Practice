## Here is a list of all the python problems that were being solved. 
### Python Problems
1. 99 bottles of beer on the wall
  - Example of a program that practices writing loops. it incorporates mathmatical equations and loops the answer until a desired number is reached for the overall goal of the     problem is to replicate a song.  
2. Cuddly Duddly youtube problem
  - Example of a program that takes python dictionaries, loops, conditionals and more to find the answer to a problem by using a regression model to find all the outcomeas of a  possible option tree and reach the desired outcome given the information about the problem. 
3. FizzBuzz operations problem
  - Example of a Simple FizzBuzz interview question to simpoly understand the users understanding of loops and conditionals in python. 
4. Harry Potter sorting hat for the wizards
  - Example of using user inputs and inserting those into conditionals to get the outcome of a test. 
5. magic 8 ball problem
  - Example of using a users input to get a random answer based on the conditions set by the user to get an outcome for the function.

9. detention loop generator
  - Example of a for loop and generating text based on the loop. 
10. guess the number
  - Example of combining a while loop with conditionals to reach a desired outcome for a program. 
11. the cyclone rollercoaster
  - Example setting values to variables and then checking those variables through a program to reach a desired outcome based on the conditions. 
12. transportation company
  - Example of setting values to variabels and checking the variables through a program. 
13. nested loop
  - Example of how to run a loop inside of a loop and the purpose for such outcome inside of a program. 
14. declare functions
  - Example of a program that creates a function. 
15. python arguments
  - Example of how to incorpotate arguments into a function and print the result. 
16. Mastering arguments
  - Example of how to incorporate arguments into a function and print the outcome. 
17. Sigma Function
  - Example of using a single argument in a function and returning the result for a program instead of printing it. 
18. Cubed python function
  - Example of how to incorporate returning a value of a function in python back to
19. FizzBuzz functions with inputs
  - Example of a typical fizzbuzz interview problem with inputs that put the input as a outcome.
